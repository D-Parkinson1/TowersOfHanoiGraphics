# Towers Of Hanoi Graphics
This repository is an extension of a project for a computer graphics course I took at uni.


I learned the techniques used through the course and https://learnopengl.com. The code has been translated to use PyOpenGL instead of C++ like the tutorial site, as this was what was used in the course.

The project is a demonstration of a solution to the Tower of Hanoi puzzle.
The 3D assets are made in blender, and the textures are photos I took, or made in blender, except for the skybox texture, which is from https://learnopengl.com.
